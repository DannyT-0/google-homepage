This is my first actual project with The Odin Project! I'm excited to learn to code with them after trying it a year ago and getting discouraged by not being able to make the google homepage. Second times the charm. Today is Tuesday December 15,2020. I'm commiting to this. 


Finished it same day but it's a rough draft. Will come back to it later once I have a better understanding of HTML and CSS and how to format well. 

Done is better than perfect
